# IPV4 Calculator

Applying all the knowledge that I could rememeber in Python to calculate IPV4 Subnet.

The codelines could be better, and perhaps I will update it. The class is divided into small methods to become easier to refactor if needed and also to understand what every method does.

Instead of a method doing more than one function at a time and being tough to debug it, I chose many smalls methods doing only one function.
